# Realtime Object Detector with Python
A simple script that loads a pre-trained model to detect objects in real time
Objects that can be detected: `["background", "aeroplane", "bicycle", "bird", "boat", "bottle", "bus", "car", "cat", "chair", "cow", "dining table", "dog", "horse", "motorbike", "person", "potted plant", "sheep", "sofa", "train", "tvmonitor"]`

_proudly made with **Paint** (the good one, not Paint3D)_
